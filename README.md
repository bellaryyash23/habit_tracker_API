# ðŸ“ŒHabit Tracker using API Requests of Python

ðŸŒŸA program which helps you track & develop your daily habits. Built using the API provided by Pixela (https://pixe.la/) which provides Github like commit graphs for free.

ðŸŒŸIt makes use of GET, POST, PUT & DELETE methods of the 'requests' module to send and receive and update data.

ðŸ‘‰In the 'main.py' file the first POST request is made to create a new user for the habit tracking program. This request includes the url endpoint of pixela and other
parameters like username & acceptance to T&C.

ðŸ‘‰Next POST request is made to create a new Graph for the provided user to track their habit. In this request the parameters like title of the graph, color of habit 
tracker pixel etc. is provided.

ðŸ‘‰Now to add a entry for any habit completed on a given day a POST request containing the parameters of date & quantity of work completed are provided which are then 
updated to our habit tracker graph.
